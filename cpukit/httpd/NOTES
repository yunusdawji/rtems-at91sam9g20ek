Notes on merging GoAhead Webs 2.1.4.  Eventually RTEMS should be supported
in their distributions and this directory removed.

Applied patch from Antti P Miettinen <antti.p.miettinen@nokia.com>.

Obtain the original distribution from http://www.goahead.com for
documentation.

Porting
=======
 - added rtems complier flags to uemf.h and misc.c
 - following source files are distributed with the web server
    but not currently used by RTEMS
    [cgi.c, sockGen.c, umui.c, websSSL.c, websda.c]

Tailoring

socket.c is RTEMS specific

Renames
