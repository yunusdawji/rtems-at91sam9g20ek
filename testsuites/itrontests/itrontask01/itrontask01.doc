This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.
This test is based upon the test in sp01.

test set name: itrontask01

directives:
  cre_tsk, exd_tsk, get_tid, sta_tsk

concepts:  XXX verify

  a.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system

  e.  Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

  f.  Verifies the executive trap handler except for the halt function.

  g.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

  a.  Verifies exd_tsk

  b.  Verifies get_tid

notes:

  rtems clock directives should change to itron clock directives when
  the clock directives are merged.

  change rtems task wake after to itron routines.

output:
 "TA1" is printed once every 5 seconds.  
 "TA2" is printed once every 10 seconds.  
 "TA3" is printed once every 15 seconds.
