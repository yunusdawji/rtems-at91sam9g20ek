 *  The Synova Mongoose-V attached one of the eight interrupt bits
 *  to a Peripheral Function Interrupt Cause Register on-CPU.
 *  This results in: 2 software interrupts, 5 interrupts
 *  through the IP bits, and 32 more from the PFICR.  Some of
 *  these are reserved but for simplicity in processing, we
 *  reserve slots for those bits anyway.
