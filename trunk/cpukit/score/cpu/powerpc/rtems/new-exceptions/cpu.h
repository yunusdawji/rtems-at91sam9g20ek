/*
 *  Does RTEMS manage a dedicated interrupt stack in software?
 *
 *  If TRUE, then a stack is allocated in _ISR_Handler_initialization.
 *  If FALSE, nothing is done.
 *
 *  If the CPU supports a dedicated interrupt stack in hardware,
 *  then it is generally the responsibility of the BSP to allocate it
 *  and set it up.
 *
 *  If the CPU does not support a dedicated interrupt stack, then
 *  the porter has two options: (1) execute interrupts on the
 *  stack of the interrupted task, and (2) have RTEMS manage a dedicated
 *  interrupt stack.
 *
 *  If this is TRUE, CPU_ALLOCATE_INTERRUPT_STACK should also be TRUE.
 *
 *  Only one of CPU_HAS_SOFTWARE_INTERRUPT_STACK and
 *  CPU_HAS_HARDWARE_INTERRUPT_STACK should be set to TRUE.  It is
 *  possible that both are FALSE for a particular CPU.  Although it
 *  is unclear what that would imply about the interrupt processing
 *  procedure on that CPU.

/*
 *  Does this CPU have hardware support for a dedicated interrupt stack?
 *
 *  If TRUE, then it must be installed during initialization.
 *  If FALSE, then no installation is performed.
 *
 *  If this is TRUE, CPU_ALLOCATE_INTERRUPT_STACK should also be TRUE.
 *
 *  Only one of CPU_HAS_SOFTWARE_INTERRUPT_STACK and
 *  CPU_HAS_HARDWARE_INTERRUPT_STACK should be set to TRUE.  It is
 *  possible that both are FALSE for a particular CPU.  Although it
 *  is unclear what that would imply about the interrupt processing
 *  procedure on that CPU.

/*
 *  Does RTEMS allocate a dedicated interrupt stack in the Interrupt Manager?

/*
 *  Should the saving of the floating point registers be deferred
 *  until a context switch is made to another different floating point
 *  task?
 *
 *  If TRUE, then the floating point context will not be stored until
 *  necessary.  It will remain in the floating point registers and not
 *  disturned until another floating point task is switched to.
 *
 *  If FALSE, then the floating point context is saved when a floating
 *  point task is switched out and restored when the next floating point
 *  task is restored.  The state of the floating point registers between
 *  those two operations is not specified.
 *
 *  If the floating point context does NOT have to be saved as part of
 *  interrupt dispatching, then it should be safe to set this to TRUE.
 *
 *  Setting this flag to TRUE results in using a different algorithm
 *  for deciding when to save and restore the floating point context.
 *  The deferred FP switch algorithm minimizes the number of times
 *  the FP context is saved and restored.  The FP context is not saved
 *  until a context switch is made to another, different FP task.
 *  Thus in a system with only one FP task, the FP context will never
 *  be saved or restored.
 *
 *  Note, however that compilers may use floating point registers/
 *  instructions for optimization or they may save/restore FP registers
 *  on the stack. You must not use deferred switching in these cases
 *  and on the PowerPC attempting to do so will raise a "FP unavailable"
 *  exception.
