@chapter Building the GNAT Cross Compiler Toolset

This chapter describes the steps required to acquire the
source code for a GNU cross compiler toolset, apply 
any required RTEMS specific patches, compile that 
toolset and install it.

@section Create the Archive and Build Directories

Start by making the @code{archive} directory to contain the downloaded 
source code and the @code{tools} directory to be used as a build
directory.  The command sequence to do this is shown
below:

@example
mkdir archive
mkdir tools
@end example

This will result in an initial directory structure similar to the
one shown in the following figure:

@example
@group
/whatever/prefix/you/choose/
        archive/
        tools/

@end group
@end example

@c @ifset use-html
@c @html
@c <IMG SRC="sfile12c.jpg" WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=178 
@c     ALT="Starting Directory Organization">
@c @end html
@c @end ifset

@section Get All the Pieces 

This section lists the components of an RTEMS cross development system.
Included are the locations of each component as well as any required RTEMS
specific patches.

    URL:         ftp://@value{RTEMSFTPSITE}@value{RTEMSFTPDIR}/ada_tools/source
@end ifset
@end example

@section Unarchiving the Tools

While in the @code{tools} directory, unpack the compressed
tar files using the following command sequence: 

@example
cd tools
tar xzf ../archive/@value{GCCTAR}
tar xzf ../archive/@value{GNAT-TAR}
tar xzf ../archive/@value{BINUTILSTAR}
tar xzf ../archive/@value{NEWLIBTAR}
tar xzf ../archive/@value{BUILDTOOLSTAR}
@end example

After the compressed tar files have been unpacked, the following
directories will have been created under tools. 

@itemize @bullet
@item @value{BINUTILSUNTAR}
@item @value{GCCUNTAR}
@item @value{GNAT-UNTAR}
@item @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}
@end itemize

There will also be a set of scripts in the current directory
which aid in building the tools and RTEMS.  They are:

@itemize @bullet
@item bit_ada
@item bit_gdb
@item bit_rtems
@item common.sh
@item user.cfg
@end itemize

When the @code{bit_ada} script is executed later in this process,
it will automatically create two other subdirectories:

@itemize @bullet
@item src
@item build-$@{CPU@}-tools
@end itemize

Similarly, the @code{bit_gdb} script will create the
subdirectory @code{build-$@{CPU@}-gdb} and
the @code{bit_rtems} script will create the
subdirectory @code{build-$@{CPU@}-rtems}.

The directory tree should look something like the following figure:

@example
@group
/whatever/prefix/you/choose/
        archive/
            @value{GCCTAR}
            @value{GNAT-TAR}
            @value{BINUTILSTAR}
            @value{NEWLIBTAR}
            @value{RTEMSTAR}
            @value{BUILDTOOLSTAR}
@ifset GCCRTEMSPATCH
            @value{GCCRTEMSPATCH}
@end ifset
@ifset BINUTILSRTEMSPATCH
            @value{BINUTILSRTEMSPATCH}
@end ifset
@ifset NEWLIBRTEMSPATCH
            @value{NEWLIBRTEMSPATCH}
@end ifset
@ifset GNAT-RTEMSPATCH
            @value{GNAT-RTEMSPATCH}

            @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}/
            bit_ada
            bit_gdb
            bit_rtems
            common.sh
            user.cfg

@c  Host Specific Notes
@c

@section Host Specific Notes

@subsection Solaris 2.x

The build scripts are written in "shell".  The program @code{/bin/sh}
on Solaris 2.x is not robust enough to execute these scripts.  If you 
are on a Solaris 2.x host, then change the first line of the files
@code{bit_ada}, @code{bit_gdb}, and @code{bit_rtems} to use the
@code{/bin/ksh} shell instead.

@section Reading the Tools Documentation

Each of the tools in the GNU development suite comes with documentation.
It is in the reader's and tool maintainers' interest that one read the
documentation before posting a problem to a mailing list or news group.

@c
@c  Localizing the Configuration
@c

@section Localizing the Configuration

Edit the @code{user.cfg} file to alter the settings of various 
variables which are used to tailor the build process.
Each of the variables set in @code{user.cfg} may be modified
as described below:

@table @code
@item INSTALL_POINT
is the location where you wish the GNU C/C++ cross compilation tools for
RTEMS to be built. It is recommended that the directory chosen to receive
these tools be named so that it is clear from which gcc distribution it
was generated and for which target system the tools are to produce code for.

@b{WARNING}: The @code{INSTALL_POINT} should not be a subdirectory 
under the build directory.  The build directory will be removed
automatically upon successful completion of the build procedure.

@item BINUTILS
is the directory under tools that contains @value{BINUTILSUNTAR}. 
For example:

@example
BINUTILS=@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}
@end example

@item GCC
is the directory under tools that contains @value{GCCUNTAR}.
For example,

@example
GCC=@value{GCCUNTAR}
@end example

Note that the gnat version is not needed because the gnat source 
is built as part of building gcc.

@item NEWLIB
is the directory under tools that contains @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}.
For example:

@example
NEWLIB=@value{NEWLIBUNTAR}
@end example

@item BUILD_DOCS
is set to "yes" if you want to install documentation.  This requires
that tools supporting documentation production be installed.  This
currently is limited to the GNU texinfo package.
For example:

@example
BUILD_DOCS=yes
@end example

@item BUILD_OTHER_LANGUAGES
is set to "yes" if you want to build languages other than C and C++.  At
the current time, the set of alternative languages includes Java, Fortran,
and Objective-C.  These alternative languages do not always build cross. 
Hence this option defaults to "no".

For example:

@example
BUILD_OTHER_LANGUAGES=yes
@end example

@b{NOTE:} Based upon the version of the compiler being used, it may not
be possible to build languages other than C and C++ cross.  In many cases,
the language run-time support libraries are not "multilib'ed".  Thus the
executable code in these libraries will be for the default compiler settings
and not necessarily be correct for your CPU model.

@item RTEMS
is the directory under tools that contails @value{RTEMSUNTAR}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_POSIX
is set to "yes" if you want to enable the RTEMS POSIX API support.
This corresponds to the 
@code{configure} option @code{--enable-posix}.

This must be enabled to support the GNAT/RTEMS run-time.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_ITRON
is set to "yes" if you want to enable the RTEMS ITRON API support.
This corresponds to the
@code{configure} option @code{--enable-itron}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_MP
is set to "yes" if you want to enable the RTEMS multiprocessing
support.  This feature is not supported by all RTEMS BSPs and
is automatically forced to "no" for those BSPs.  This corresponds to the
@code{configure} option @code{--enable-multiprocessing}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_CXX
is set to "yes" if you want to build the RTEMS C++ support including
the C++ Wrapper for the Classic API.  This corresponds to the
@code{configure} option @code{--enable-cxx}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_TESTS
is set to "yes" if you want to build the RTEMS Test Suite.  If this
is set to "no", then only the Sample Tests will be built.  Setting
this option to "yes" significantly increases the amount of disk
space required to build RTEMS.
This corresponds to the @code{configure} option @code{--enable-tests}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_TCPIP
is set to "yes" if you want to build the RTEMS TCP/IP Stack.  If a
particular BSP does not support TCP/IP, then this feature is automatically
disabled.  This corresponds to the @code{configure} option
@code{--enable-tcpip}.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_NONDEBUG
is set to "yes" if you want to build RTEMS in a fully optimized
state.  This corresponds to executing @code{make} after configuring
the source tree.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_DEBUG
is set to "yes" if you want to build RTEMS in a debug version.
When built for debug, RTEMS will include run-time code to 
perform consistency checks such as heap consistency checks.
Although the precise compilation arguments are BSP dependent,
the debug version of RTEMS is usually built at a lower optimization
level.  This is usually done to reduce inlining which can make
tracing code execution difficult.  This corresponds to executing
@code{make VARIANT=debug} after configuring
the source tree.

@item INSTALL_RTEMS
is set to "yes" if you want to install RTEMS after building it.
This corresponds to executing @code{make install} after configuring
and building the source tree.

@item ENABLE_RTEMS_MAINTAINER_MODE
is set to "yes" if you want to enabled maintainer mode functionality
in the RTEMS Makefile.  This is disabled by default and it is not
expected that most users will want to enable this.  When this option
is enabled, the build process may attempt to regenerate files that
require tools not required when this option is disabled.
This corresponds to the @code{configure} option
@code{--enable-maintainer-mode}.

@end table

@section Running the bit_ada Script

After the @code{bit_ada} script has been modified to reflect the
local installation, the modified @code{bit_ada} script is run
using the following sequence:

@example
cd tools
./bit_ada <target configuration>
@end example

Where <target configuration> is one of the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item hppa1.1
@item i386
@item m68k
@item powerpc
@item sh
@item sparc
@end itemize

NOTE:  The above list of target configurations is the list of RTEMS supported
targets.  Only a subset of these have been tested with GNAT/RTEMS.  For more
information, contact your GNAT/RTEMS representative.

The build process can take a while to complete.  Many users find it
handy to run the build process in the background, capture the output
in a file, and monitor the output.  This can be done as follows:

@example
./bit_ada <target configuration> >bit.log 2>&1 &
tail -f bit.log
@end example

If no errors are encountered, the @code{bit_ada} script will conclude by 
printing messages similar to the following:

@example

The src and build-i386-tools subdirectory may now be removed.

Started:  Fri Apr 10 10:14:07 CDT 1998
Finished: Fri Apr 10 12:01:33 CDT 1998
@end example

If the @code{bit_ada} script successfully completes, then the
GNU C/C++ cross compilation tools are installed.

If the @code{bit_ada} script does not successfully complete, then investigation
will be required to determine the source of the error.

@c Common Problems

@section Common Problems

@subsection Error Message Indicates Invalid Option to Assembler

If a message like this is printed then the new cross compiler
is most likely using the native assembler instead of the cross
assembler or vice-versa (native compiler using new cross assembler).
This can occur for one of the following reasons:

@itemize @bullet

@item Binutils Patch Improperly Applied
@item Binutils Not Built
@item Current Directory is in Your PATH

@end itemize

If you are using binutils 2.9.1 or newer with certain older versions of
gcc, they do not agree on what the name of the newly 
generated cross assembler is.  Older binutils called it @code{as.new}
which became @code{as.new.exe} under Windows.  This is not a valid
file name, so @code{as.new} is now called @code{as-new}.  By using the latest
released tool versions and RTEMS patches, this problem will be avoided.

If binutils did not successfully build the cross assembler, then 
the new cross gcc (@code{xgcc}) used to build the libraries can not
find it.  Make sure the build of the binutils succeeded.

If you include the current directory in your PATH, then there
is a chance that the native compiler will accidentally use
the new cross assembler instead of the native one.  This usually
indicates that "." is before the standard system directories
in your PATH.  As a general rule, including "." in your PATH
is a security risk and should be avoided.  Remove "." from
your PATH.

NOTE:  In some environments, it may be difficult to remove "."
completely from your PATH.  In this case, make sure that "."
is after the system directories containing "as" and "ld".

@subsection Error Messages Indicating Configuration Problems

If you see error messages like the following,

@itemize @bullet

@item cannot configure libiberty
@item coff-emulation not found
@item etc.

@end itemize

Then it is likely that one or more of your gnu tools is 
already configured locally in its source tree.  You can check
for this by searching for the @code{config.status} file
in the various tool source trees.  The following command
does this for the binutils source:

@example
find @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} -name config.status -print
@end example

The solution for this is to execute the command 
@code{make distclean} in each of the GNU tools
root source directory.  This should remove all
generated files including Makefiles.

This situation usually occurs when you have previously
built the tool source for some non-RTEMS target.  The
generated configuration specific files are still in
the source tree and the include path specified during
the RTEMS build accidentally picks up the previous
configuration.  The include path used is something like
this:

@example
-I../../@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}/gcc -I/@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}/gcc/include -I.
@end example

Note that the tool source directory is searched before the 
build directory.

This situation can be avoided entirely by never using 
the source tree as the build directory -- even for
