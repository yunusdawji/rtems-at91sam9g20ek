Various non BSP dependant support routines.

clock - Uses the 403 PIT (Programmable interval timer) to
	generate RTEMS clock ticks.

console - Uses the 403 Internal serial port to do RTEMS
	console I/O.  Not ALL members of the 403 family
	have this.

include - Currently empty

timer - Uses the 403 timebase register for timing
	tests.  Other PowerPCs have slightly different
	timebase register definitions.

vectors - PowerPC 403 specific vector entry points.
	Includes CPU dependant, application independant
	handlers: alignment.
