Tools Required
==============
The following tools are used in the production of this documentation:

TeX
texinfo 4.0
texi2www-960103 (included in tree)

This was used by the authors to generate the directory tree figure
in the texinfo printed version:

tree (from the CTAN Archives -- see http://jasper.ora.com/ctan.html)

Changing the Version Number and Timestamp
=========================================

RTEMS Version number is in configure.in.  Edit that file and run bootstrap.

Documentation date is in common/setup.texi.in and also must be modified
by hand.  bootstrap does not have to be run after modifying this file.

Making the Documentation
========================

cd rtems-XXX/doc
../bootstrap
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
cd tools ; make
cd ..
make info
make all
make install

Cleaning
========

make clean
make distclean
make maintainer-clean

Making a Source Distribution
============================
This generates a rtems-<version>.tar.gz in the toplevel directory.

Making a Preformatted Distribution
==================================
Install and tar it up. :)

Common Problems
===============

TeX pool_size too small.
