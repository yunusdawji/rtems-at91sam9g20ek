@chapter Miniature In-Memory Filesystem

This chapter describes the Miniature In-Memory FileSystem (miniIMFS).  
The miniIMFS is a reduced feature version of the IMFS designed to
provide minimal functionality and have a low memory footprint.

This chapter should be written after the IMFS chapter is completed
and describe the implementation of the mini-IMFS.
