@chapter Building the GNU Cross Compiler Toolset

NOTE:  This chapter does @b{NOT} apply if you installed
prebuilt toolset executables for BINUTILS, GCC, NEWLIB,
and GDB.  If you installed prebuilt executables for all
of those, proceed to @ref{Building RTEMS}.  If you require
a GDB with a special configuration to connect to your
target board, then proceed to @ref{Building the GNU Debugger GDB}
for some advice.

This chapter describes the steps required to acquire the
source code for a GNU cross compiler toolset, apply 
any required RTEMS specific patches, compile that 
toolset and install it.

It is recommended that when toolset binaries are available for
your particular host, that they be used.  Prebuilt binaries
are much easier to install.

The individual components in the RTEMS Development Toolset are
updated independently of one another by their respective
maintainers.  In addition, the patches which the RTEMS Project
has determined are necessary are subject to change as users
report issues on individual host and target platforms.  As
a result, it is possible that the versions listed in this
document are @b{NOT} the latest ones available.  The latest
patches for each tool are always available from RTEMS CVS
on the respective branch and should always be mirrored on the
RTEMS ftp site.  It is recommended that before building a
toolset from source, you verify you are using the
latest patches.

@c  Unarchiving the Tools
@c
@subsection Unarchiving the Tools

NOTE: This step is required if building BINUTILS, GCC, and NEWLIB
using the procedure described in @ref{Using configure and make}.
It is @b{NOT} required if using the procedure
described in @ref{Using RPM to Build BINUTILS GCC and NEWLIB}.

GNU source distributions are archived using @code{tar} and
compressed using either @code{gzip} or @code{bzip}.
If compressed with @code{gzip}, the extension @code{.gz} is used.
If compressed with @code{bzip}, the extension @code{.bz2} is used.

While in the @code{tools} directory, unpack the compressed
tar files for BINUTILS, GCC, and NEWLIB using the appropriate
command based upon the compression program used.

@example
cd tools
tar xzf ../archive/TOOLNAME.tar.gz  # for gzip'ed tools
tar xjf ../archive/TOOLNAME.tar.bz2 # for bzip'ed tools
@end example

After the compressed tar files have been unpacked using
the appropriate commands, the following
directories will have been created under tools. 

@itemize @bullet
@item @value{BINUTILSUNTAR}
@item @value{GCCUNTAR}
@item @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}
@end itemize

The tree should look something like the following figure:

@example

@subsection Compiling and Installing BINUTILS GCC and NEWLIB

There are two supported methods to compile and install BINUTILS, GCC,
and NEWLIB:

@itemize @bullet
@item RPM
@item direct invocation of @code{configure} and @code{make}
@end itemize

Direct invocation of @code{configure} and @code{make} provides more control
and easier recovery from problems when building.

@c
@c  Using RPM to Build BINUTILS GCC and NEWLIB
@c

@subsubsection Using RPM to Build BINUTILS GCC and NEWLIB

NOTE:  The procedures described in the following sections must
be completed before this step:

@itemize @bullet
@item @ref{Obtain Source and Patches for BINUTILS GCC and NEWLIB}
@end itemize

RPM automatically unarchives the source and applies any needed
patches so you do @b{NOT} have to manually perform the procedures
described @ref{Unarchiving the Tools} and 
@ref{Applying RTEMS Patches}.

This section describes the process of building binutils, gcc, and
newlib using RPM.  RPM is a packaging format which can be used to
distribute binary files as well as to capture the procedure and
source code used to produce those binary files.  Before
attempting to build any RPM from source, it is necessary to
ensure that all required source and patches are in the @code{SOURCES}
directory under the RPM root (probably @code{/usr/src/redhat} or
@code{/usr/local/src/redhat}) on your machine.  This procedure
starts by installing the source RPMs as shown in the following 
example:

@example 
rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-binutils-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}-@value{BINUTILSRPMRELEASE}.src.rpm
rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-@value{GCCVERSION}-@value{GCCRPMRELEASE}.src.rpm
@end example

The RTEMS tool source RPMS are called "nosrc" to indicate that one or
more source files required to produce the RPMs are not present.  
The RTEMS source RPMs typically include all required patches, but do not 
include the large @code{.tar.gz} or @code{.tgz} files for
each component such as BINUTILS, GCC, or NEWLIB.  These are shared
by all RTEMS RPMs regardless of target CPU and there was no reason
to duplicate them.  You will have to get the required source
archive files by hand and place them in the @code{SOURCES} directory
before attempting to build.  If you forget to do this, RPM is
smart -- it will tell you what is missing.  To determine what is
included or referenced by a particular RPM, use a command like the
following:

@example
@c Don't use @value{GCC*} below. This is an example
$ rpm -q -l -p @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-3.2.3-1.src.rpm
gcc-3.2.3-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-20030507a.diff
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems4.7-gcc.spec
newlib-1.11.0-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-20030507.diff
@end example

Notice that there are patch files (the @code{.diff} files) and a file 
describing the build procedure and files produced (the @code{.spec} file),
but no source archives (the @code{*tar.*} files).
When installing this source RPM 
(@code{rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-newlib-gcc3.2.3newlib1.11.0-1.src.rpm}),
the @code{.spec} file is placed in the @code{SPECS} directory under the RPM root
directory, while the @code{*.diff} files are placed into the @code{SOURCES}
directory.

@c
@c  Configuring and Building BINUTILS using RPM
@c

@subheading Configuring and Building BINUTILS using RPM

The following example illustrates the invocation of RPM to build a new,
locally compiled, binutils binary RPM that matches the installed source 
RPM.  This example assumes that all of the required source is installed.

@example
cd <RPM_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/SPECS
rpm -bb i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-binutils-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}.spec
@end example

If the build completes successfully, RPMS like the following will
be generated in a build-host architecture specific subdirectory
of the RPMS directory under the RPM root directory.

@example
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}binutils-common-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}-@value{BINUTILSRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-binutils-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}-@value{BINUTILSRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@end example

NOTE: It may be necessary to remove the build tree in the
@code{BUILD} directory under the RPM root directory.

@c
@c  Configuring and Building GCC and NEWLIB using RPM
@c

@subheading Configuring and Building GCC and NEWLIB using RPM

The following example illustrates the invocation of RPM to build a new,
locally compiled, set of GCC and NEWLIB binary RPMs that match the
installed source RPM.  It is also necessary to install the BINUTILS
RPMs and place them in your PATH.  This example assumes that all of
the required source is installed.

@example
cd <RPM_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/RPMS/i386
rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}binutils-common-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}-@value{BINUTILSRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-binutils-@value{BINUTILSVERSION}-@value{BINUTILSRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
export PATH=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}/bin:$PATH
cd <RPM_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/SPECS
rpm -bb i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-@value{GCCVERSION}-newlib-@value{NEWLIBVERSION}.spec
@end example

If the build completes successfully, a set of RPMS like the following will
be generated in a build-host architecture specific subdirectory
of the RPMS directory under the RPM root directory.

@example
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}gcc-common-@value{GCCVERSION}-@value{GCCRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-newlib-@value{NEWLIBVERSION}-@value{GCCRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-@value{GCCVERSION}-@value{GCCRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gcc-c++-@value{GCCVERSION}-@value{GCCRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm

NOTE: Some targets do not support building all languages.

NOTE: It may be necessary to remove the build tree in the
@code{BUILD} directory under the RPM root directory.

newlib manually using @code{configure} and @code{make} directly.

@c
@c  Configuring and Building BINUTILS
@c

@subheading Configuring and Building BINUTILS

The following example illustrates the invocation of
@code{configure} and @code{make}
to build and install @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} for the
sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} target:

@example
mkdir b-binutils
cd b-binutils
../@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}/configure --target=sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} \
  --prefix=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}
make
make install
@end example

After @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} is built and installed the 
build directory @code{b-binutils} may be removed.

For more information on the invocation of @code{configure}, please
refer to the documentation for @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} or 
invoke the @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} @code{configure} command with the
@code{--help} option.

NOTE: The shell PATH variable needs to be updated to include the path
the binutils user executables have  been installed in.  The directory
containing the executables is the prefix used above with
@file{bin} post-fixed.

@example
export PATH=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}/bin:$@{PATH@}
@end example

Failure to have the binutils in the path will cause the GCC and NEWLIB
build to fail with an error message similar to:

@example
sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-ar: command not found
@end example

@c
@c  Configuring and Building GCC and NEWLIB
@c

@subheading Configuring and Building GCC and NEWLIB

Before building @value{GCCUNTAR} and @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}, 
@value{BINUTILSUNTAR} must be installed and the directory
containing those executables must be in your PATH.

The C Library is built as a subordinate component of 
@value{GCCUNTAR}.  Because of this, the @value{NEWLIBUNTAR}
directory source must be available inside the @value{GCCUNTAR}
source tree.  This is normally accomplished using a symbolic
link as shown in this example:

@example
cd @value{GCCUNTAR}
ln -s ../@value{NEWLIBUNTAR}/newlib .
@end example

The following example illustrates the invocation of
@code{configure} and @code{make}
to build and install @value{GCCUNTAR} with only
C and C++ support for the sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} target:

@example
mkdir b-gcc
cd b-gcc
../@value{GCCUNTAR}/configure --target=sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} \
   --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-newlib --verbose \
   --enable-threads --enable-languages="c,c++" \
   --prefix=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}
make all
make info
make install
@end example

After @value{GCCUNTAR} is built and installed the 
build directory @code{b-gcc} may be removed.

For more information on the invocation of @code{configure}, please
refer to the documentation for @value{GCCUNTAR} or
invoke the @value{GCCUNTAR} @code{configure} command with the

@c Building GCC with Ada Support
@c
@subheading Building GCC with Ada Support

If you want a GCC toolset that includes support for Ada
(e.g. GNAT), there are some additional requirements on
the host environment and additional build steps to perform.
It is critical that you use the same version of GCC/GNAT as
the native compiler.  GNAT must be compiled with an Ada compiler
and when building a GNAT cross-compiler, it should be
the same version of GNAT itself.

The build procedure is the same until the configure step. 
A GCC toolset with GNAT enabled requires that @code{ada}
be included in the set of enabled languages.
The following example illustrates the invocation of
@code{configure} and @code{make}
to build and install @value{GCCUNTAR} with only
C, C++, and Ada support for the sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} target:

@example
mkdir b-gcc
cd @value{GCCUNTAR}/gcc/ada
touch treeprs.ads [es]info.h nmake.ad[bs]
cd ../../../b-gcc
../@value{GCCUNTAR}/configure --target=sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} \
   --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-newlib --verbose \
   --enable-threads --enable-languages="c,c++,ada" \
   --prefix=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}
make all
make info
make -C gcc cross-gnattools
make -C gcc ada.all.cross
make -C gcc GNATLIBCFLAGS="USER_SELECTED_CPU_CFLAGS" gnatlib
make install
@end example

After @value{GCCUNTAR} is built and installed the 
build directory @code{b-gcc} may be removed.

@c Building the GNU Debugger GDB
@c

@section Building the GNU Debugger GDB

NOTE: This step is NOT required if prebuilt executables for
the GNU Debugger GDB were installed.

The GNU Debugger GDB supports many configurations but requires some
means of communicating between the host computer and target board.
This communication can be via a serial port, Ethernet, BDM, or ROM emulator.
The communication protocol can be the GDB remote protocol or GDB
can talk directly to a ROM monitor.  This setup is target board 
specific.  The following configurations have been
successfully used with RTEMS applications:

@itemize @bullet
@item BDM with ColdFire, 683xx, MPC860 CPUs
@item Motorola Mxxxbug found on M68xxx VME boards
@item Motorola PPCbug found on PowerPC VME, CompactPCI, and MTX boards
@item ARM based Cogent EDP7312
@item PC's using various Intel and AMD CPUs including i386,
i486, Pentium and above, and Athlon
@item PowerPC Instruction Simulator in GDB (PSIM)
@item MIPS Instruction Simulator in GDB (JMR3904)
@item Sparc Instruction Simulator in GDB (SIS)
@item Sparc Instruction Simulator (TSIM)
@item DINK32 on various PowerPC boards
@end itemize

GDB is currently RTEMS thread/task aware only if you are using the
remote debugging support via Ethernet.  These are configured
using gdb targets of the form CPU-RTEMS.  Note the capital RTEMS.

It is recommended that when toolset binaries are available for
your particular host, that they be used.  Prebuilt binaries
are much easier to install but in the case of gdb may or may
not include support for your particular target board.

the @code{gzip} program, it will have a suffix of @code{.bz2} and
you should use @code{bzcat} instead of @code{cat} as shown above.

Check to see if any of these patches have been rejected using the following
sequence:

@example
cd tools/@value{GDBUNTAR}
find . -name "*.rej" -print
@end example

If any files are found with the .rej extension, a patch has been rejected.
This should not happen with a good patch file.

@subsection Compiling and Installing the GNU Debugger GDB

There are three methods of building the GNU Debugger:

@itemize @bullet
@item RPM
@item direct invocation of @code{configure} and @code{make}
@end itemize

Direct invocation of @code{configure} and @code{make} provides more control
and easier recovery from problems when building.

@subsubsection Using RPM to Build GDB

This section describes the process of building binutils, gcc, and
newlib using RPM.  RPM is a packaging format which can be used to
distribute binary files as well as to capture the procedure and
source code used to produce those binary files.  Before
attempting to build any RPM from source, it is necessary to
ensure that all required source and patches are in the @code{SOURCES}
directory under the RPM root (probably @code{/usr/src/redhat} or
@code{/usr/local/src/redhat}) on your machine.  This procedure
starts by installing the source RPMs as shown in the following
example:

@example
rpm -U @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}-@value{GDBRPMRELEASE}.src.rpm
@end example

Because RTEMS tool RPMS are called "nosrc" to indicate that one or
more source files required to produce the RPMs are not present.
The RTEMS source GDB RPM does not include the large @code{.tar.gz} or
@code{.tgz} files for GDB.  This is shared by all RTEMS RPMs
regardless of target CPU and there was no reason
to duplicate them.  You will have to get the required source
archive files by hand and place them in the @code{SOURCES} directory
before attempting to build.  If you forget to do this, RPM is
smart -- it will tell you what is missing.  To determine what is
included or referenced by a particular RPM, use a command like the
following:

@example
$ rpm -q -l -p @value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}-@value{GDBRPMRELEASE}.src.rpm
gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-@value{GDBPATCHVERSION}.diff
gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}.tar.gz
i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}.spec
@end example

Notice that there is a patch file (the @code{.diff} file), a source archive
file (the @code{.tar.gz}), and a file describing the build procedure and
files produced (the @code{.spec} file).  The @code{.spec} file is placed
in the @code{SPECS} directory under the RPM root directory.

@c  Configuring and Building GDB using RPM
@c

@subheading Configuring and Building GDB using RPM

The following example illustrates the invocation of RPM to build a new,
locally compiled, binutils binary RPM that matches the installed source
RPM.  This example assumes that all of the required source is installed.

@example
cd <RPM_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/SPECS
rpm -bb i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}.spec
@end example

If the build completes successfully, RPMS like the following will
be generated in a build-host architecture specific subdirectory
of the RPMS directory under the RPM root directory.

@example
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}gdb-common-@value{GDBVERSION}-@value{GDBRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@value{RTEMSRPMPREFIX}i386-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}-gdb-@value{GDBVERSION}-@value{GDBRPMRELEASE}.i386.rpm
@end example

@b{NOTE}: It may be necessary to remove the build tree in the
@code{BUILD} directory under the RPM root directory.

@c Using the GDB configure Script Directly
@c 

@subsubsection Using the GDB configure Script Directly

This section describes how to configure the GNU debugger for
RTEMS targets using @code{configure} and @code{make} directly.
The following example illustrates the invocation of @code{configure}
and @code{make} to build and install @value{GDBUNTAR} for the
m68k-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} target:

@example
mkdir b-gdb
cd b-gdb
../@value{GDBUNTAR}/configure --target=m68k-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI} \
  --prefix=@value{RTEMSPREFIX}
make all
make info
make install
@end example

For some configurations, it is necessary to specify extra options
to @code{configure} to enable and configure option components
such as a processor simulator.  The following is a list of
configurations for which there are extra options:

@table @b
@item powerpc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}
@code{--enable-sim --enable-sim-powerpc --enable-sim-timebase --enable-sim-hardware}

@item sparc-rtems@value{RTEMSAPI}
@code{--enable-sim}

@end table

After @value{GDBUNTAR} is built and installed the
build directory @code{b-gdb} may be removed.

For more information on the invocation of @code{configure}, please
refer to the documentation for @value{GDBUNTAR} or
invoke the @value{GDBUNTAR} @code{configure} command with the
@code{--help} option.

@section Common Problems

@subsection Error Message Indicates Invalid Option to Assembler

If a message like this is printed then the new cross compiler
is most likely using the native assembler instead of the cross
assembler or vice-versa (native compiler using new cross assembler).
This can occur for one of the following reasons:

@itemize @bullet

@item Binutils Patch Improperly Applied
@item Binutils Not Built
@item Current Directory is in Your PATH

@end itemize

If you are using binutils 2.9.1 or newer with certain older versions of
gcc, they do not agree on what the name of the newly
generated cross assembler is.  Older binutils called it @code{as.new}
which became @code{as.new.exe} under Windows.  This is not a valid
file name, so @code{as.new} is now called @code{as-new}.  By using the latest
released tool versions and RTEMS patches, this problem will be avoided.

If binutils did not successfully build the cross assembler, then
the new cross gcc (@code{xgcc}) used to build the libraries can not
find it.  Make sure the build of the binutils succeeded.

If you include the current directory in your PATH, then there
is a chance that the native compiler will accidentally use
the new cross assembler instead of the native one.  This usually
indicates that "." is before the standard system directories
in your PATH.  As a general rule, including "." in your PATH
is a security risk and should be avoided.  Remove "." from
your PATH.

@b{NOTE}:  In some environments, it may be difficult to remove "."
completely from your PATH.  In this case, make sure that "."
is after the system directories containing "as" and "ld".

@subsection Error Messages Indicating Configuration Problems

If you see error messages like the following,

@itemize @bullet

@item cannot configure libiberty
@item coff-emulation not found
@item etc.

@end itemize

Then it is likely that one or more of your gnu tools is
already configured locally in its source tree.  You can check
for this by searching for the @code{config.status} file
in the various tool source trees.  The following command
does this for the binutils source:

@example
find @value{BINUTILSUNTAR} -name config.status -print
@end example

The solution for this is to execute the command
@code{make distclean} in each of the GNU tools
root source directory.  This should remove all
generated files including Makefiles.

This situation usually occurs when you have previously
built the tool source for some non-RTEMS target.  The
generated configuration specific files are still in
the source tree and the include path specified during
the RTEMS build accidentally picks up the previous
configuration.  The include path used is something like
this:

@example
-I../../@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}/gcc -I/@value{BINUTILSUNTAR}/gcc/include -I.
@end example

Note that the tool source directory is searched before the
build directory.

This situation can be avoided entirely by never using
the source tree as the build directory.
